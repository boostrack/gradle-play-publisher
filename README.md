# gradle-play-publisher

Gradle plugin to upload your APK and app details to the Google Play Store. Needs the ```com.android.application``` plugin applied. Supports the Android Application Plugin as of version ```1.0.0```.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher)

## Prerequisites

To use the publisher plugin you have to create a service account for your existing Google Play Account. See https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started for more information. 

Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:

Once you finished the setup you have a so called *service account email address* and a *p12 key file* that we will use later on.

## Usage

Add it to your buildscript dependencies:

```groovy
buildscript {

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
    	// ...
        classpath 'com.github.triplet.gradle:play-publisher:1.0.4'
    }
}
```

Apply it:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.github.triplet.play'
```

The plugin creates the following tasks for you:

* `publishApkRelease` - Uploads the APK and the summary of recent changes.
* `publishListingRelease` - Uploads the descriptions and images for the Play Store listing.
* `publishRelease` - Uploads everything.
* `bootstrapReleasePlayResources` - Fetch all existing data from the Play Store to bootstrap the required files and folders.

Make sure to set a valid `signingConfig` for the release build type. Otherwise, there won't be a publishable APK and the above tasks won't be available.

In case you are using product flavors you will get one of the above tasks for every flavor. E.g. `publishApkPaidRelease` or `publishListingPaidRelease`.

## Configuration

Once you have applied this plugin to your android application project you can configure it via the ```play``` block.

### Credentials

Drop in your service account email address and the p12 key file you generated in the API Console here.

```groovy
play {
    serviceAccountEmail = 'your-service-account-email'
    pk12File = file('key.p12')
}
```

### Play Store Metadata

You can also update the Play Store Metadata automatically along with your APK. 

To use this feature, create a special source folder called ```play```. Inside, create a folder for each locale you want to support. Then drop your summary of recent changes into a file called ```whatsnew```. The title, the description, the short description and the YouTube video url go into their own files in a subfolder called ```listing```. Once set up, your project should look something like this:

```
- [src]
  |
  + - [main]
      |
      + - [play]
          |
          + - [en-US]
          |   |
          |   + - [listing]
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - fulldescription
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - shortdescription
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - title
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - video
          |   |
          |   + - whatsnew
          |
          + - [de-DE]
              |
              + - [listing]
              |   |
              |   + - fulldescription
              |   |
              |   + - shortdescription
              |   |
              |   + - title
              |   |
              |   + - video
              |
              + - whatsnew
```

Note: You can provide different texts for different locales, build types and product flavors. You may even support additional locales for some build types or product flavors.

### Text requirements
To make sure your texts comply to the requirements of the Play Store, there is a check build-in that causes the build to fail if your text will exceed the allowed lengths.

The limits are:

* Title: *90 characters*
* Short description: *80 characters*
* Long description: *4000 characters*
* Recent changes : *500 characters*

To prevent this check for some reason, you can toggle it with the ```errorOnSizeLimit``` property:

```groovy
play {
    // ...
    errorOnSizeLimit = false
}
```

### Specify the track

As a default your APK is published to the alpha track and you can promote it to beta or production manually. If you want to directly publish to another track you can specify it via the ```track``` property:

```groovy
play {
    // ...
    track = 'production' // or 'beta' or 'alpha'
}
```

It is also possible to provide a separate summary of recent changes for each track. Just drop in a special `whatsnew-alpha` text file alongside your main `whatsnew` file and that one will be used if you publish to the alpha track.

### Upload Images

Currently images are only uploaded if you explicitly say so:

```groovy
play {
    // ...
    uploadImages = true
}
```

In that case the plugin looks for the Play Store images in your `play` folder. So just drop all your images into a folder structure similar to:

```
- [src]
  |
  + - [main]
      |
      + - [play]
          |
          + - [en-US]
              |
              + - [listing]
                  |
                  + - [featureGraphic]
                  |
                  + - [icon]
                  |
                  + - [phoneScreenshots]
                  |
                  + - [promoGraphic]
                  |
                  + - [sevenInchScreenshots]
                  |
                  + - [tenInchScreenshots]
```

Note: The plugin currently does not enforce the correct size and file type. If you try to upload invalid files, the Google API will fail with a detailed error message.

Note: We still have some issues when you change the images in those folders. For now you should do a full rebuild whenever you change them.

## Advanced Topics

### Run custom tasks before publishing

Sometimes it's required to execute some custom tasks right before executing tasks from the `play` plugin.

For example, one can have necessity to download images for the store listing from a remote 3rd-party server.
This should happen before executing the `generateReleasePlayResources` task which is responsible for collecting all the play store assets for upload. 

Let's assume we have a task called `loadStoreListingFromRemote` that fetches store listing information from a remote server and places it under `src/main/play` as needed by the `play` plugin. Our `generateReleasePlayResources` task should now depend on that other task. In order to do that, we have to add the follwing lines to our build script:

```groovy
project.afterEvaluate {
    def generateReleasePlayResources = project.tasks.getByName("generateReleasePlayResources")
    generateReleasePlayResources.dependsOn loadStoreListingFromRemote
}
```

Note that we have to wait for the evaluation phase to complete before the `generateReleasePlayResources` task becomes visible.
